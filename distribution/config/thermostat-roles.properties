# This file is used if the PropertiesUsernameRolesLoginModule is used
# as a delegate in the JAAS configuration *and* the 'roles.properties' option
# has not been specified for the login module.
#
# If that is the case, this file does two things:
#    1.  It maps user names to roles.
#    2.  Defines an optional recursive set of roles. This is useful in order to
#        define role sets. Users can then be members of such defined role sets.
#        Note that every line which does not have a user name (as defined in the
#        corresponding users.properties file) on the left hand side of the
#        equals sign ('='), represents a role.
#
# A user is assigned multiple roles by separating them by a comma ','. Every
# entity in this file which isn't a user name, will be implicitly defined as a
# role.
#
# Format is as follows:
#
# user1 = my-role, my-role2
# user2 = new-role, role1
# role1 = other-role
#
# Considering users 'user1' and 'user2' are defined in users.properties, the
# above would assign 'user1' the roles 'my-role' and 'my-role2'. 'user2' would
# be a member of 'new-role', 'role1' and 'other-role' (transitively via role1)
#
#
#
# Example recursive role definition allowed-to-do-everything agent-users. You
# can uncomment the following lines and assign your agent users this
# "thermostat-agent" role.
#thermostat-agent = thermostat-add, thermostat-replace, thermostat-update, \
#                  thermostat-remove, thermostat-save-file, thermostat-purge, \
#                  thermostat-register-category, thermostat-register-category, \
#                  thermostat-cmdc-verify, thermostat-login, thermostat-realm
#
# Example recursive role definition for allowed-to-see-everything client-users.
# You may uncomment the following lines and assign your client users this
# "thermostat-client" role.

#                    thermostat-cmdc-generate, thermostat-load-file, \
#                    thermostat-get-count, thermostat-register-category, \
#                    thermostat-prepare-statement

# Example recursive role definition that grants all command channel privileges.
