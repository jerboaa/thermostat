 <description>
  <p>Thermostat is an instrumentation tool for the Hotspot JVM,
     with support for monitoring multiple JVM instances on multiple hosts,
     optionally in a cloud environment.
  </p>
  <p>
     The name Thermostat is intended as a play on words: Thermostat is to Hotspot much as IcedTea is to Java.</p>
