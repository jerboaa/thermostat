HACKING
=======

This guide provides an introduction and some rules for developing
Thermostat.

Layout
------

Thermostat code is organized in a few different ways.

The core functionality is split into `common`, `client`, and `agent`
modules (and their submodules).

The rest is split functionally: `storage` contains storage-related
code, `launcher` is the main launcher and so on. To introduce a new
functional component of thermostat, put it in its own top-level
directory and make it a new module.

Major new features should go into their own module(s). Each module is
an OSGi bundle.

Plugins shipped with thermostat are put into their own separate
top-level modules in the source. Examples include `host-cpu` and
`vm-gc`. For the sake of consistency, name a vm-specific plugin with a
`vm-` prefix and a host-only plugin with a `host-` prefix.

A module that gathers a particular data is generally split as follows:

- `common`: shared code between the agent and the client
- `agent`: code that should only be executed on the agent
- `client`: code that should be executed client-side only
- `cli`: code that is meant for the command line only
- `swing`: code meant for the graphical runtime environment only
- `distribution`: a non-code module that bundles the entire plugin
  into a single zip file.

Use a single package as the module root package. Base it on the name
of the module. For a `vm-foo` module, use
`com.redhat.thermostat.vm.foo`. Avoid vague terms like `thermostat`
and `utils` in the package names.

POM Files
---------

Define the version for any dependency in the root (or main) `pom.xml`
file. Define it as a property named `project-name.version`. Example:
`commons-cli.version`.

If the OSGi version differs from the project version, define it as a
separate property `project-name.osgi-version`. Example:
`commons-codec.osgi-version`.


Code Style
----------

The standard license header goes on top of every file. It's enforced
using a maven plugin. Use `mvn license:format` to generate/update it.
The license template is defined in `src/license/header.txt`.

Above all, be consistent with the style of code you are modifying.

Formatting Style:
- Spaces instead of tabs
- Avoid trailing spaces

Use this style:

    public class Foo {
        public void foo(Bar bar, Baz baz) {
            try {
                if (possible) {
                    doFoo(bar);
                }
            } catch (FooException | BarExcetpion e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }



Tests
-----

Every class `Foo` should have a unit test named `FooTest`. The test
should be in the same package. Test-specific hooks should be package
private in the original class.

GUI code should be unit tested using FEST and Caciocavallo.

For complex features, an integeration test should also be added if
possible. Integration tests go in the `integration-tests` module.


Documentation
-------------

Add appropriate documentation, for both developers and users.

Use the active voice for all user-facing documentation.

Classes that are part of the public API should have some documentation
describing their use and linking to other relevant classes.

Commands should have both summaries and descriptions. Write both the
summary and description in active and action-oriented style. For the
summary prefer direct and short forms: 'foo the bar' over 'foos the
bar by bazing the ...'.

A command's summary is displayed as a short help message. Make it short.
Do not capitalize it, or end it with a period.

A command's description is displayed as a long help message. Make it
fully describe the command, including its actions and side-effects.
Describe all options. Use full sentences, each ending with a period.


Commits
-------

All commits must build and pass all unit tests.

Commits require review. Before pushing a commit, make sure it is
reviewed on the mailing list by at least one other developer and any
concerns have been resolved.

Commit messages are normally of the form:

    Short summary of the fix

    A detailed description of fix with additional details, like steps to
    reproduce the problem, explanation of any subtle changes, links to
    docs or anything that might help when examining this changeset in the
    future to figure out why a change was done.

    Also, try and keep commit message lines to under 80 characters.

    You can also link a bug using the PR notation. Something like "This
    commit fixes PR666", which refers to a bug with the id 666 on
    http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla/

    The last few lines are important. They list the reviewers and a link to
    the mailing list thread (or the equivalent) where this patch was
    reviewed.
